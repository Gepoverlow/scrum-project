# SCRUM: A Geeky Ebay, but better!
Cool font, G-Bay as logo, color and design: very geeky, fun, interactive, flashy,...
Bol.com functionality, looks dry and commercial, but fun interactiveness
Amazon/2dehands for pure products, but make everything geeky
Payments need to be clear, email confirm payment happened, payment system not needed

To-Do
Create a dummy repository to practice Git Pull Requests behaviour

---

### Questions

How will the payment happen
Will they send their logo/brand so we can design website accordingly
What websites should we use for a reference, what do they like about that website?
What fun features would they like to add if we have enough time?

---

Workflow
Rest API/Node.JS for backend, React for front-end.
GitHub behaviour: Setting up small branches for big features, and add smaller branches to those for smaller features.
Pull requests: ask coaches => They recommend learning Pull Requests, this is a very common practice, will help avoid unintentional mistakes
Using Trello: When an event is done, communicate it on Discord (create pull requests)
