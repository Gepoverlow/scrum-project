      <h1>About us</h1>
      <p>
        It all started 15 years ago... A group of 4 friends would get together every Friday after school to trade Pokemon cards like there was no
        tomorrow. During the week we would cut 1 dollar off every meals budget, so that by Thursday we would be able to buy our Booster packs... It
        was a feeling that's very hard to explain, but very easy to share. Fridays were a day we would look forward to!
        <br />

      <p>
        <br />
        With time, our passion for other geeky-collectibles grew bigger. We would all dream of a platform where we could easily connect with other
        geeky-lovers and share our goodies!
        <br />
      </p>

      <p>
        <br />
        So it finally clicked, we had the idea of creating a nice environment in where people can buy, sell and trade interesting collectibles, so
        everyday is back to being a Friday: Thus, G-BAY was born!
